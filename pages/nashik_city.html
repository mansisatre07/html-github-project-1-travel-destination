It was later captured by the Marathas in the 17th century, then by the Mughals, and finally by the British in 1818. The fort is renowned for its unique architecture, including nearly vertical rock-cut stairs designed to confuse enemies, and its strategic location on a triangular rock formation in the Nashik district of Maharashtra</p>

<p>Peruchi Wadis opening hours are from 08:30 to 16:00. We arrived at the restaurant at 4 pm, but the staff graciously served us steaming hot Misal Thali. Since it was raining, we also enjoyed hot kanda bhaji (onion fritters) and Peru (guava) ice cream, which was unique and absolutely delicious. I loved my visit here for two reasons: the yummy food and the visit to the Pakshyanchi Wadi (bird park).</p>
<p>Built on a guava farm, this place is located approximately 35 km from Nashik Road railway station and 6.1 km from Gangapur Road. Peruchi Wadi is an ideal one-day picnic spot near Mumbai for family and friends. If youre a Misal lover traveling with kids, this isn’t just a restaurant—it’s an amusement park! The bird park features amazing species of animals and birds. My little one was thrilled to visit the bird park and had a wonderful time.</p>
