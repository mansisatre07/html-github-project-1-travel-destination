 <u><h3>About:</h3></u><p><b>Harihara is famous for Harihareshwara Temple and Thungabadhra River.</b>Harihar Fort (Harshagad) is a historic fort in India's Nashik district, Maharashtra, known for its steep, vertical rock-cut steps and triangular rock formation, making it a popular trekking destination. Built by the Yadava dynasty to guard Gonda Ghat trade routes, the fort features religious idols and water cisterns.<br/> Accessible from base villages like Harshewadi and Nirgupada, it offers panoramic views of other Sahyadri forts from its summit at <b>3,676 feet.</b></p>
 <u><h3>History:</h3></u>
 <p>Harihar Fort was built between the 9th and 14th centuries by the Yadava dynasty. It was later captured by the Marathas in the 17th century, then by the Mughals, and finally by the British in 1818. The fort is renowned for its unique architecture, including nearly vertical rock-cut stairs designed to confuse enemies, and its strategic location on a triangular rock formation in the Nashik district of Maharashtra</p>
